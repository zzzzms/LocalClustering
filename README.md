1. Code for CS-LCE Algorithm as detailed in the paper "Graph-based Semi-supervised Local Clustering with Few Labeled Nodes" by Zhaiming Shen, Ming-Jun Lai and Sheng Li, which appears in IJCAI 2023. Here is the link to the paper: https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/466

2. The dataset for MNIST experiment can be sent individually upon request. It is too large to be uploaded.
